# ATM Machine Demo App

I built this demo app using React.js + TypeScript, create-react-app template.
As mentioned in the description, I used assets provided and built the same UI for atm machine.

# Areas to improve (I can do this if I have more time on this)
- If given ample time on this project, I can create automated testing features for both unit and e2e testing to ensure the app's correctness and quality.
- For better coding practices, I could implement CSS modules, which provide scoped styling and eliminate name collisions.
- Additionally, I could build a separate back-end using technologies such as Node.js, Express.js to showcase my full-stack development capabilities.
- To simplify deployment efforts, it may also be beneficial to implement docker containerization.


# How to run
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- go to `localhost:3000` and you can see atm-machine

# Scenarios
I think it would be easy to test all the functionalities.
Just FYI, when you click buttons like `Enter PIN`, `Withdraw`, `Deposit`, `Balance`, you will see an input element with auto focused. You can use keyboard to enter values and finally press `Enter` key to proceed.

And also I used Google Chrome in development.
