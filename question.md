An ATM (automated teller machine) is a device used to provide access to financial services such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiry, account transactions, and in some cases, bill payments. It is a self-service machine that allows customers to complete banking transactions without the need for a teller or bank representative.

The workings of an ATM machine involve several components such as:

1. Card Reader - An ATM machine reads the customer's bank card using a magnetic stripe or chip on the card. The card reader communicates with the customer's bank to determine the account balance and to authenticate the user.

2. Keypad - The ATM keypad is used for entering a personal identification number (PIN) to access the account and initiate transactions. It also allows the customer to select the different transaction options available.

3. Display Screen - The ATM display screen provides the user with visual prompts and instructions on how to complete transactions. It is also used to display account transactions and balance information.

4. Cash Dispenser - The cash dispenser is located in the bottom part of the ATM machine and it dispenses cash to the customer. When the user requests a cash withdrawal, the ATM verifies the account balance, dispenses the cash, and deducts the amount from the customer's account balance.

5. Receipt Printer - After each transaction, the ATM provides the user with a printed receipt which contains transaction details such as the account balance, withdrawal amount, and available funds. 

The different functional buttons on ATM machines include:

1. Withdrawal Button - Allows the user to withdraw cash from their account, select the amount needed, and then receive the money from the cash dispenser.

2. Balance Inquiry Button - Allows the user to check their account balance to access how much money they have in their account.

3. Deposit Button - Allows the user to deposit cash or checks into their account.

4. Bill Payment Button - Allows users to pay bills such as rent, utilities, and credit card payments.

5. Transfer Button - Allows the user to transfer funds between their accounts or transfer money to another account holder.

In summary, ATM machines are self-service machines that allow customers to complete banking transactions such as cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and bill payments. The machine works by reading the customer's bank card, verifying the user identity using a PIN, and communicating with the bank to verify the account balance and initiate transactions. ATM machines consist of several components such as a card reader, keypad, display screen, cash dispenser, and receipt printer. The different functional buttons on ATM machines include withdrawal, balance inquiry, deposit, bill payment, and transfer buttons.
